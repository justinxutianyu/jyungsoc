<DIV><h2>Introduction</h2>
  The bayes package provides an implementation of a Map Reduce enabled naive bayes classifier. The naive bayes
  classifier is a very simple classifier that counts the occurrences of words in association with a label which
  can then be used to determine the likelihood that a new document, and it's words, should be assigned a particular
  label.
</DIV>
<div><h2>Implementation</h2>

  <p>The implementation is divvyied up into three parts:
  <ol>
    <li>The Trainer -- responsible for doing the counting of the words and the labels</li>
    <li>The Model -- responsible for holding the training data in a useful way</li>
    <li>The Classifier -- responsible for using the trainers output to determine the category of previously unseen
      documents
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <div><h3>The Trainer</h3>

    <p>The trainer is manifested in several classes:
    <ol>
      <li>{@link #org.apache.mahout.classifier.bayes.TrainerDriver} -- Creates the Hadoop Naive Bayes job and outputs
        the model
      </li>
      <li>{@link org.apache.mahout.classifier.bayes.BayesMapper} -- Takes a chunk of input data and counts the label and
        the association of the features and the label
      </li>
      <li>{@link org.apache.mahout.classifier.bayes.BayesReducer} -- Collapses the input from the {@link
        org.apache.mahout.classifier.bayes.BayesMapper} into a single representation of the model that contains all of
        the label and feature counts
      </li>
    </ol>
    The trainer assumes that the input files are in the {@link org.apache.hadoop.mapred.KeyValueTextInputFormat}, i.e.
    the first token of the line
    is the label, and the remaining tokens on the line are the unique features (words). Thus, input documents might look
    like:
    <pre>
      hockey puck stick goalie forward defenseman referee ice checking slapshot helmet
      football field football pigskin referee helmet turf tackle
    </pre>
    where hockey and football are the labels and the remaining words are the features associated with those particular
    labels.</p>
    <p>The output from the trainer is a {@link org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile}.</p>
  </div>
  <div><h3>The Model</h3>
    <p>The {@link org.apache.mahout.classifier.bayes.Model} is the data structure used to represent the results of the training
    for use by the {@link org.apache.mahout.classifier.bayes.Classifier}.  A Model can be created by hand, or, if using
    the {@link org.apache.mahout.classifier.bayes.TrainerDriver}, it can be created from the {@link
      org.apache.hadoop.io.SequenceFile} that is output.  To create it from the SequenceFile, use the
      {@link org.apache.mahout.classifier.bayes.io.SequenceFileModelReader} located in the io subpackage.</p>
  </div>
  <div><h3>The Classifier</h3>

    <p>The {@link org.apache.mahout.classifier.bayes.Classifier} is responsible for using a {@link
      org.apache.mahout.classifier.bayes.Model} to classify
      documents into categories.</p>
